                      My journey as a Full Stack Developer

                 <strong>Introduction</strong> 
                 <br>
                  This post is about my road and how I self taught myself to become a full-stack web developer.
                </p>
                 <strong>Early days</strong> 
                  <p>
                    In my second year at university, I was first introduced to python. While I have heard of it and knew it is used in every platform but I didn't see how. As I was writing programs to reverse a string or other basic things. Then I watched a pycon(Python Conference) and they were talking about Django. I knew that django was a python framework to make web apps but didn't knew that it was that easy to learn for someone who knows python.

                  </p>
                  <strong>The real talk</strong> 
                  <p>
                    I used to follow simple youtube project tutorials like making a blog or todo website. Then I would go through that tut and read code and try to figure out how it is working with other parts. After that my favorite part I would imagine an imaginary student and try to teach him how to make that project. I would even crack some jokes with him and act like a totally different person. While doing some important parts like a database or implementing some more complex algorithms I would grab his more attention as the more he learns more I will get the benefit.
                    I would go through the documentation or simply copy my error in google but never try to open that previous code because it's ok to solve problems on your own by asking rather than copying simple things without knowing it's used.
                    <br>

                    When I start to get bored or the information is too much to grasp I simply divide it into chunks and take slowly and slowly as Rome wasn't built in a single day. 
                  </p>
                  <strong>New Challenge</strong> <br>
                  <p>

                      But knowing backend language or framework wasn't enough as the websites I built were not dynamic. Then I get knowledge about dom and dynamic websites. I knew that I have to learn frontend framework in order to do so. Again I feel like a beginner. Searching "the best framework" in google to easy frontend framework I tried everything. Later when I watch a documentary about vue.js and the speaker talk about its learning curve I thought to take a peek and I enjoyed the view(vue). I started with it's documentaion and it was butterly smooth as it was supported out of the box by laravel (a php framework) which even helps django developers as a simple link to its cdn and boom vue is implemented in your site. Then when I get a bit deep inside javascript world where I found a different world. Again new terminologies and concepts were moving in my head and at this point I got my answer to the very question I was asking myself, when can I introduce myself as a expert web developer.I knew the answer; never. No matter how much I learn there was something more to learn. Some new concepts , more advanced ideas arised day by day. But to solve certain problems we don' t need all that technology I would only focus my self on those things which I need for any particular projects. And by projects I mean dummy projects.

                  <strong>Conclusion</strong>
                  <p>
                    Sometimes being super focus by knowing what you can do to pick your battles could land you with an unexpected result. By today I have worked on many projects like e-commerce, insurance comparing sites, some of my own non profit projects and I have contributed in many open source projects.There's always something to learn and I have never stop learning a single day.
